CodeIgniter project for my PHP and Javascript/jQuery demo site. 

Tied to a MySQL database. Using Ajax calls for text entry, database queries, and jQuery operations. Also has a line of Angular.js to count the characters as you type.

Every time you click on the color boxes or the random password generator, you're creating more Javascript circles behind the scenes that gradually float into view in the blue banner bar across the top.
